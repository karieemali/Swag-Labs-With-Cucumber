# Description
Swag Labs is a fictional e-commerce platform used for testing and training in software development, particularly in automated testing environments. It features a variety of products that can be added to a shopping cart, allowing users to simulate online shopping experiences.

When using Cucumber, a popular tool for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), you can create test scenarios that describe how users interact with the Swag Labs website. These scenarios often include steps for visiting the site, logging in, adding items to the cart, and completing a purchase.

I used a BDD technique with Cucumber to write and run multiple Features to test the website correctly

I used the strongest design pattern that deals with selenium, which is Page Object Model "POM"

I first started browsing the site well to know the important functionality so that I could focus on it during the testing stage

## main functionality
The main functionality of the website is that the user works on "Add Products to your cart" and at the same time "checkout to products added" so that the purchase process is completed successfully.

‚ö° UserLogin

‚ö° SortingByAToZ
